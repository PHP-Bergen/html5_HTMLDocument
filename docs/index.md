# Background

Working with the web, we often need a safe and standardised way of working with:

* URL and URI 
* The ability to parse/create HTML Documents.

## [Dom\HTMLDocument](dom.md)

Introduced in [PHP 8.4](https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/en.php) as two PHP RFC:

* [PHP RFC: DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser) 
* [PHP RFC: Focussing on CSS selector support](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dom_additions_84)

## [URI Parsing API](uri.md)

Introduced in PHP 8.5. Enable a native standardised way of working with URL's.
